Despite the fact that extensive list of linked open datasets are available in catalogues, most of the data publishers still connects their datasets to the most popular ones, such as DBpedia, Freebase and Geonames. Although the linkage with popular datasets would allow us to explore external resources, it would fail to cover highly specialized information. Catalogues of linked data describe the content of datasets in terms of the update periodicity, authors, SPARQL endpoints, linksets, amongst others, as recommended by W3C VoID Vocabulary. However, catalogues by themselves do not provide any explicit information to help the URI linkage process.

Searching techniques can rank available datasets according to the likelyhood that it will be possible to find links between them and a given target dataset, so that most of the links, if not all, could be found by inspecting the most relevant datasets in the ranking.

This dataset contains dataset descriptions using the VoID vocabulary for supporting the evaluation of searching techniques. The descriptions of each dataset include their linksets, classes, properties and topic categories which were harvested from the Datahub catalogue, dataset dumps, void files and the DBpedia knowledge graph. The DBpedia Spotlight allowed the detection of named entities in textual literals and thereafter of the DBpedia topic categories of each entity which were taken as the topic categories od the datasets containing de entities.
