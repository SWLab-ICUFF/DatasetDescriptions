This repository contains descriptions of Linked Data datasets using VoID vocabulary. The descriptions include Linksets, classes, properties and topic categories and mashes up data from DataHub, dataset dumps, VoID files and DBpedia. The DBpedia Spotlight allowed the recognition of named entities in literal values. Each entity is associated with a list of topic categories through the predicate _dcterms:subject_ and each topic category is subsumed by others through the predicate _skos:broader_. A category _c_ is a topic category of a dataset _iff_ there exists a property path _{e dcterms:subject/skos:broader* c.}_ from a named entity _e_ of the dataset to _c_ in DBpedia.
