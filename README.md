This repository contains descriptions of Linked Data datasets using VoID vocabulary. The descriptions include Linksets, classes, properties and topic categories. Descriptions are Data Mashups of DataHub, dataset dumps, VoID files and DBpedia. The DBpedia Spotlight allowed the detection of named entities in literal values. Each entity is associated with a list of topic categories through the predicate dcterms:subject and each topic category is subsumed by others through the predicate skos:broader. A category c is a topic category of a dataset iff there exists a property path {e dcterms:subject/skos:broader* c.} from a named entity e of the dataset to c in DBpedia.
